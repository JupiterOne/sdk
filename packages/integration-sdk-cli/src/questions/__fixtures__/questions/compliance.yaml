  title: Ensure that IAM users are not assigned the Service Account User or Service Account Token Creator roles at project level
  description: >
    It is recommended to assign the Service Account User (iam.serviceAccountUser)
    and Service Account Token Creator (iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator) roles to
    a user for a specific service account rather than assigning the role to a
    user at project level.
