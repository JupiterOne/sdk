# Development

Add details here to give a brief overview of how to work with the provider APIs.
Please reference any SDKs or API docs used to help build the integration here.

## Prerequisites

Supply details about software or tooling (like maybe Docker or Terraform) that
is needed for development here.

Please supply references to documentation that details how to install those
dependencies here.

Tools like Node.js and NPM are already covered in the [README](../README.md) so
don't bother documenting that here.

## Provider account setup

Please provide information about the steps needed to create an account with a
provider. Images and references to a provider's documentation is very helpful
for new developers picking up your work.

## Authentication

Supply details here for information on how to authenticate with a provider so
that developers have an idea of what's needed to hit APIs. It may be useful to
provide explanations for each value specified in the
[`IntegrationInstanceConfigFieldMap`](../src/config.ts).
