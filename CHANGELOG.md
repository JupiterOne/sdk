[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `JobState.setData(key, data)` and `JobState.getData(key)` allow steps to
  communicate arbitrary data to dependent steps.

## 1.1.2 - 2020-05-15

- Slight modifications to support mapped relationships

## 1.1.1 - 2020-05-14

### Added

- `Entity` now includes a property `id?: string` to represent the
  [`id` property supported by the data model](https://github.com/JupiterOne/data-model/blob/f07f085b39041e639f5dacd9b6140c6c3db0b5ad/src/schemas/Entity.json#L10).
  This allows for easy reference to `Entity.id` in later steps that iterate
  already-loaded entities and don't want to assume that the `_key` _is_ the
  provider's identifier (often the `_key` needs additional data to make it
  unique). Note that we plan to soon provide TS types for all the data model
  types.

### Changed

- BREAKING! Historically, the `IntegrationInstance.config` was typed as `any`.
  This provided no type safety. Now, integrations must declare an interface
  represeting the structure of their `IntegrationInstance.config` and provide
  this as a type parameter in code where there is a need to access the `config`
  properties. The type parameter is not required (defaults to type `object`),
  but there will be no access to properties (without an evil type cast to
  `any`).

  The following types now support a generic parameter for the `instance.config`
  they or their properties reference:

  - `IntegrationInstance`,
  - `IntegrationInvocationConfig`,
  - `IntegrationExecutionContext`,
  - `IntegrationStepExecutionContext`
  - `IntegrationStep`
  - `GetStepStartStatesFunction`
  - `StepExecutionHandlerFunction`
  - `InvocationValidationFunction`
  - `createMockExecutionContext`

## 1.1.1 - 2020-05-14

### Added

- Documentation on `IntegrationError` to clarify that it is not meant to be used
  directly outside the SDK.
- New errors that integrations should throw to communicate provider API errors
  during `validateInvocation` or any step. These will terminate the step, but
  provide more details to users to help them resolve some kinds of provider API
  errors.
- `JobState.addEntity` and `JobState.addRelationship` allow collecting one
  entity/relationship at a time. This supports tight looping and encourages
  quick processing of provider data to minimize memory requirements by
  offloading converted data as soon as possible. This does not mean that
  `addEntities/Relationships` should be avoided of course.
- Documentation of `JobState` to help those of us with short memories and
  on-hover documentation rendering in VSCode and other such modern editors. 🤠
  This also allows for communicating to new developers who just jump into the
  code.

### Changed

- Removed an unused error `IntegrationConfigValidationError`.
- Renamed `IntegrationLocalConfigFieldTypeMismatch` to
  `IntegrationLocalConfigFieldTypeMismatchError`, to match other error names.

### Fixed

- When the job state exceeded the upload batch size, multiple uploads were
  performed, but each upload included the entire dataset so that the
  synchronizer complained about duplicate keys.

## 1.1.0 - 2020-05-13

### Added

- Added additional logging to `finalizeSynchronization` and
  `executeIntegrationInstance`.

### Changed

- `registerSynchronizationJobContext` now returns a child logger.
- `initiateSynchronization` registers the synchronization job with the `logger`
  and returns a child logger with more information.

### Fixed

- Added `bunyan` and `polly` types to `dependencies` so that TypeScript
  consumers do not receive missing `d.ts` file type errors.

## 1.0.0 - 2020-05-12

### Added

- Support loading invocation configuration from `src/index`.

### Deprecated

- Deprecated convention style loading.

### Changed

- Bumped to `1.0.0` so that dependent projects can get regular semver rules and
  cleaner updates.

## 0.18.0 2020-05-01

### Added

- Automatic event logging around steps (start, end, and failure).
- An `errorCode`, `errorId`, and `reason` is now displayed in step failure
  events and logs.
- Event logging around errors thrown in `validateInvocation` function.
- Abort synchronization job when `run` and `sync` command fails.

### Changed

- Duplicate `_key` values are now detected and integration execution will now
  stop. Duplicate `_key` tracking is also performed when using mock step
  context.

## 0.17.0 2020-05-01

### Added

- `IntegrationConfigLoadError`, to be thrown when there is a configuration load
  error. This can be used by non-local execution environments that load
  configuration from somewhere special.

### Fixed

- Template missing necessary publish build.
